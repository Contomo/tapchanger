The dock comes in 3 versions - cross beam mounted, top mounted or on rails.

| Top mounted  | Cross beam | Liftbar | 
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |
| * Can be installed in existing frame<br> * Good clearance |  * Supports Full sized Stealthburner <br>* Extra docking latch | * Complex to build <br>* Slightly faster changes<br>* Can install on Trident |

# Liftbar dock 

See [Liftbar instructions](./Liftbar/Liftbar.md)

# Other docks BOM

 - High temp silicone for the nozzle pad
 - 35 mm of 7x0.1mm springsteel, salvageable from 1m tape measure.  
 - some M3 screws and heatset inserts
 - *retnetion hardware* - see below



# Toolhead retention

There are 2 versions of retentiom mechanism, this will likely converge as I get more relibility data

## Screw head hook

Dragon burner uses this method.
The toolhead hooks on to the M3 scew heads. Just need 2x m3x10 butthonhead screws.

## Bottom pin + magnet dropped in the toolhead hole.

You will need:
  - 2x 5x2mm round magnets
  - 2x m3 x 10 steeel screws in the dock - steel (magnetic)
  - the screws in toolhead also need to be seel to stick to the magnets

Stealthburner and mini stelathburner on cross beam uses this approach.
It relies on the bottom pin as the main retention mechanism and the magnet is just to prevent it rattling around.

Drop the magnets on the screw heads in the toolhead. They will stay there on their own, no glue required.

# Cross Beam Frame BOM

Essentially you need to build this. The exact dimensions depend on your printer size.

# Nozzle pad

Print the nozzle pad mold. Put on some mold release, just rubbing with a birthday candle works well. 

Cut a 35mm piece of springsteel and mold the silicone pad on one end.
The mount is designed to accomodate fror the springteel curve, place it so that it curves downwards.
